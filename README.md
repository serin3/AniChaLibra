# üìö AniChaLibra

**AniChaLibra** is a lightweight, anime-themed character database built for developers, anime fans, and toolmakers who need structured, categorized character data for various uses (search systems, bots, games, etc).

---

## üîç Overview

AniChaLibra organizes anime characters in a clean and structured JSON format that includes:

- üßë‚Äçüé§ **Character Details**: Name, age, gender, personality, image link...
- üì∫ **Anime Info**: Title, Character Role.
- üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß **Relatives**: Includes familial relationships (father, mother, sibling, etc.) if available.

Example:
```json
    {
        "id": "1",
        "character": {
            "name": "Keigo Asano",
            "age": "27",
            "birth": "April-1",
            "gender": "Male",
            "race": "Human",
            "status": "Alive",
            "appearances": "Chapter 213",
            "married": "no",
            "personality": "Keigo is usually a goofy and extremely hyper-active boy, often using overly-dramatic movements and words to act out his feelings. He enjoys watching fireworks, playing role-playing games, and going to beach parties.",
            "image": "https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.NjJ2tQeJrkK0u98BioVMFwAAAA?w=261&h=300&c=10&rs=1&bgcl=fffffe&r=0&o=6&pid=23.1"
        },
        "anime": {
            "name": "Bleach",
            "quote": "Did you guys hear a truck crashed into Ichigo's house!!!",
            "role": "Supporting"
        },
        "relatives": {
            "sister": "Mizuho Asano"

## üÜï Add Character Feature (v5.0.0)

‚ú® New in version 5.0.0: You can now add your own characters to the local database using the new Add Character panel!

## ‚úÖ Features

Simple web form for submitting a new character.

Automatically prevents duplicates (by checking names).

Instant integration into the local JSON file.

Includes client-side validation and feedback messages.

## üîí Note

This feature is available only in local environments or via authorized tools. It doesn't affect the remote GitHub version unless synced manually.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

```txt
üìÅ data/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ animeChDB.json   # All characters stored in a unified JSON file
Characters are not stored in separate files ‚Äî everything is centralized in animeChDB.json.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
You can fetch and parse the character data in your applications, Discord bots, or web interfaces.

Example using fetch in JavaScript:

```js
fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serin3/AniChaLibra/master/data/animeChDB.json')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    const keigo = data.find(c => c.name.includes("Keigo"));
    console.log(keigo);
  });
```

## üìå Notes
relatives will only be included when the character has known relatives.

All entries are manually curated to ensure quality and consistency.

The `id` is a unique integer for every character.

Character images are externally hosted (mostly from official sources or anime galleries).

---

## ‚ûï Add Character Panel

To use the character-adding panel:

1. Clone or download the project locally.
2. Ensure you have `animeChDB.json` inside the correct `/data` directory.
3. Run a local development server (e.g. with **Live Server**, Express, or similar).
4. Open the **Add Character** page from the interface.
5. Submissions will directly modify your local `animeChDB.json`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Changes will not persist or work unless a proper local environment is active
